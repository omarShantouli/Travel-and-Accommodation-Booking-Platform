# Travel-and-Accommodation-Booking-Platform
Welcome to the Travel and Accommodation Booking Platform—a dynamic project aimed at revolutionizing the online hotel booking experience. Our focus is on crafting clean, secure, and efficient APIs that power key features such as user authentication, seamless search results, detailed hotel information, and a secure checkout process. With an emphasis on RESTful principles and robust error handling, I’m creating a foundation for a reliable and user-friendly platform.
